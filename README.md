## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 5 - Build the Future of Al Computer Control with Screenpipe's - Terminator**

---

## üéØ Objective

So our Project solves UI flow Manual Testing of any Local or 
Publicly Available Software for windows by Automating it with the help of Screenpipe's Terminator.
And Generating Test Cases by using Gemini 2.0 flash.
If software is local then we can make own Test cases.

## üß† Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`CryptoCares`

### Team Members:  
- Jui Kalan [https://github.com/juikalan21]
- Nikita Jadhav [https://github.com/nikitaacodes]
- Arpit Mohankar [https://github.com/arpitmohankar/]
- Himanshu Gupta [https://github.com/himasnhu018]

### Your Approach:  
- We saw Screenpipe is new startup who providing good usecase product named Terminator.  
- Major challenge was Learning Sources was less availability on Internet, 
because its a new startup project  
- We read all docs and took AI help and we succeed to use Terminator MCP server in our project.

## üß™ How to Run the Project

### Requirements:
- Node.js / Typescript Config.
- API Key of Gemini 2.0 Flash.
#### .env file setup:-
- GEMINI_API_KEY="key"
- TERMINATOR_SERVER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:9375"

### Local Setup:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/nikitaacodes/MetricMind.git

# Install dependencies
cd MetricMind
npm install

# Terminator server cli install and run
npm run metricmind

# Now open new terminal and paste this command
npm start calc
#or
npm start notepad
#or
npm start "any App Name"
```

## üß¨ Future Scope

### Further Frontend Interface is coming, wait.
- soon - where you will need to Enter Software name or Software Exe file path OR "if software/application is local/your own, then make own test cases rather than gemini AI generation"

## üìé Resources / Credits

- used Gemini 2.0 flash
- took help from screenpipe's Terminator Typescript SDK docs

## üèÅ Final Words

First we started reading Screenpipe's Docs then tried to use that 
but learning sources was less, and it was not working, then we got to know that Problem
Statements changed so we scrap old project and started new by using Screenpipe's Terminator and read whole Docs
, finally we succeed to make and run that project.
It was our first experience working with MCP SERVER terminator. And we enjoyed a lot.
Thanks Hackhazard team for choosing Good Problem Statements, we learned a lot while working.
we dont know if our project will be selected but we are still happy that 
we give our best during our College End Sem Exam period. Unless we were having good 
future plans for this project to work on before submission.
So Thank You so much HackHazard team to organize this hackathon and for including Screenpipe Problem Statements.
